# rat-in-maze

The codes can be found in src. This includes "ratmaze.h" as header file, "ratmaze.cpp" as definition file and "main.cpp" for simple execution.

The maze is hard-coded but one can easily change the size by either defining a new constructor for the maze class or simply editing the header file.
The code will work on a maze of any size as long as the assumptions are satisfied.

Assumptions:
1. Rat always starts at (0,0) and ends at (n-1,n-1).
2. There exists only one solution and no node has two separate route,i.e. the rat can either move down or right.   //Although this feature can be added to store different routes
3. The rat can only move Down(D) and Right(R).


Well that's it for now! Enjoy Jerry's adventure :)

Please Note: I have already compiled the code so you'll have the executable and objects file in the code. Please clear before you compile.
